From React Native 0.73, your project's Metro config should extend '@react-native/metro-config'
or it will fail to build. Please copy the template at:
https://github.com/react-native-community/template/blob/main/template/metro.config.js
This warning will be removed in future (https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/1018).
